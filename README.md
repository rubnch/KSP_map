# KSP interactive map

An interactive, browser-based map of Kerbal Space Program planetary systems: navigate like the in-game map view, read a delta-v map generated from the actual system, and browse a timeline of optimal transfer windows. Stock first, then popular planet packs (OPM, JNSQ, RSS, Kcalbeloh).

## Development

Requires Node 22.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm test           # unit tests (Vitest)
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript project build
npm run build      # static site in dist/
```

## Layout

| Path | What lives there |
| --- | --- |
| `src/core/` | Orbit maths and data types. No UI code. |
| `src/map/` | The 3D / top-down map view (react-three-fiber). |
| `src/ui/` | Panels and controls around the map. |
| `data/packs/*.json` | One system per file in the unified format. |
| `data/schema/system.schema.json` | JSON Schema every pack is validated against in the tests. |
| `tools/converter/` | (later) Offline converter from Kopernicus configs to packs. |

### Pack format

Every system, stock or modded, is one JSON file following `data/schema/system.schema.json`: pack metadata (source mod and pinned version, calendar, root and home body) and a flat list of bodies. Each body has its parent, physical properties (radius, gravitational parameter, rotation, optional atmosphere and SOI) and Keplerian orbital elements relative to its parent. Units are metres and seconds, and **all angles are degrees** (including mean anomaly at epoch, which KSP itself stores in radians). Bodies use flat colours rather than mod textures, for licensing reasons.

## Deployment

`main` deploys to GitHub Pages through `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Pages must be enabled once in the repository settings with **Source: GitHub Actions**.
